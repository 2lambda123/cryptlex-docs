# Installation Guide

## Docker Compose

All of the Cryptlex Docker images may be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cryptlex). If youâ€™re looking for a complete configuration to get up and running quickly, use our Docker Compose example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptlex/cryptlex-on-premise
docker-compose up
```

The stock `.env` file contains the following values, you will want to modify the `POSTGRES_DB` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.

```text
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=cryptlex

WEB_DOMAIN=cryptlex.mycompany.com
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that the server has a public IP address and a web domain, as running `docker-compose` command will automatically try to generate an SSL certificate through LetsEncrypt to enable HTTPS.

### Docker services <a id="docker-services"></a>

In the above example configuration you will find a database, cache, GeoIP,  Cryptlex web API and dashboard and load balancer services. Read below to better understand how each service is configured.

#### Database service <a id="database-service"></a>

At a minimum, you will need to either set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `db` service section, or more ideally set the value in the host environment `.env` file. Ensure the other properties fit your requirements.

#### Cache service \(optional\) <a id="search-service"></a>

It uses Redis for storing IP rate limiting data. If no Redis database is provided it defaults to memory. No configuration is needed.

#### GeoIP service <a id="search-service"></a>

This service is used to get location information from the IP address of the user. No configuration is needed.

#### Web API service

At a minimum, you must set the following environment variables present in the `webapi.env` file:

* `RSA_PASSPHRASE`: Use a 16 character random secret. This is used to encrypt the RSA private key generated for each product you create in the dashboard.
* `JWT_SECRETKEY`: Use at least 32 ASCII characters long random secret. This secret if compromised can be used to compromise the whole account.
* `APPLICATION_LICENSE_KEY`: The license key which you get after you purchase the license for the Cryptlex On-Premise server.

Other than the above three you need to set environment variables for the email provider \(MailGun, SendGrid or SMTP\) and additionally you can configure other monitoring and error reporting services.

The web API can be accessed at following URL: https://${WEB\_DOMAIN}/v3/status

#### Dashboard service

It hosts the Cryptlex web dashboard at port 4200. It is a single page application and should ideally be hosted on Github, Netlify or S3.

To configure the dashboard you need to set following environment variables in the `dashboard` service section:

* `COMPANY_NAME`: This shows up in the browser title.
* `COMPANY_WEBSITE`: Your company website.
* `COMPANY_LOGO_URL`: Logo to be displayed in the dashboard.
* `COMPANY_WHITE_LOGO_URL`: White coloured version of your company logo.
* `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY`: Google analytics key.

The dashboard can be accessed at following URL: http://${WEB\_DOMAIN}:4200

#### Load balancer service

It's an Nginx and LetsEncrypt docker image which acts as a reverse proxy and automatically generates and renews the SSL certificate for the `WEB_DOMAIN`.

To configure the load balancer service, set the `EMAIL` environment variable in the `loadbalancer` service section and `WEB_DOMAIN` environment variable in `.env` file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`WEB_DOMAIN` environment variable must be set to a valid domain which can be accessed over the internet.
{% endhint %}

## Hosting dashboard

The Cryptlex dashboard should ideally be hosted on third party services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Github](https://pages.github.com/)  which provide globally load balanced, static website servers free of cost.

## Using third-party GeoIP service

Instead of using [cryptlex/freegeoip](https://hub.docker.com/r/cryptlex/freegeoip) server for getting location information from the IP address, Cryptlex also supports [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/) and [ipdata](https://ipdata.co/) third-party GeoIP services. 

### Configuring ipstack

To configure the ipstack you need to set following environment variables in the `webapi` service section:

```text
webapi:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      GEOIPSERVER_URL: https://api.ipstack.com
      GEOIPSERVER_APIKEY: ${IPSTACK_ACCESS_KEY}
```

### Configuring ipdata

To configure the ipdata you need to set following environment variables in the `webapi` service section:

```text
webapi:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      GEOIPSERVER_URL: https://api.ipdata.co
      GEOIPSERVER_APIKEY: ${IPDATA_API_KEY}
```
