# System Requirements

## OS

Cryptlex On-premise is deployed using Docker. Hence it can be deployed on any Linux and Windows based servers that can run current versions of Docker. 

## Storage

Cryptlex requires a minimum of 5GB to function for its database and docker images. Your exact storage size requirements will vary depending on the volume of licenses and number of activations.

## CPU

Cryptlex requires at least a dual-core CPU, and that will work for low volume installations. For anything more than that we recommend going with a quad-core CPU.

## Memory

Cryptlex requires at least 512MB of memory to function.

## Software

### Docker

Cryptlex requires at least version 17.05.0-ce of Docker. Our installation scripts will help you install a suitable version of Docker if you donâ€™t already have one.
