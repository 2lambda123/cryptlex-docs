# Customer Portal

Your customers can also log into the dashboard to manage their own license keys. They can view their license keys, update their profile etc.

The customer portal can be accessed at following URL:

`https://{{companyId}}.cryptlex.app`

## Managing licenses

Your customers can view all their licenses and few details regarding the licenses like total activations and deactivations, allowed activations and deactivations, validity, status etc.

## Offline activation and deactivation

Your customers can also use the portal for offline activations and deactivations. This saves you a considerable amount of time on product support.

## User profile

Your customers can also see and update their profile details like first name, last name, email and password. 

## Need more features {#need-more-help}

In case you need more features in the customer portal, we'll be glad to add them in the portal. You can either post your requests on our [support forum](https://forums.cryptlex.com) or can contact us through [email](mailto:support@cryptlex.com?Subject=Using%20LexActivator).
