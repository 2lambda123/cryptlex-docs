The European Parliament adopted [the GDPR](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf) in April 2016, replacing an outdated data protection directive from 1995. It carries provisions that require businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. We will apply the GDPR to all the users whose personal data is either stored within Cryptlex or who use our services, whether inside or outside of the EU.

Cryptlex processes Personal Data both as a Processor and as a Controller, as defined in the Directive and the GDPR.

**1.2.3.1 Controller**

In the GDPR “controller’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union/Member State law.

For user data, as outlined in section 1.2.1, Cryptlex will be the data controller.

For user data, as outlined in section 1.2.2, you \(our customer\) will be the data controller.

**1.2.3.2 Processor**

The processor is the entity which processes personal data on behalf of the controller under the controller’s instructions.

We \(Cryptlex\) are a data processor.

#### 1.2.3.3. Lawful basis of processing

If you are our User, we process your Personal Data based on your consent and based on the need to perform the obligations of our contract with you. We collect and use Personal Data for the purposes of providing the Services to our Users at their instruction, processing Personal Data on behalf of Users, improving the Services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.

**1.2.3.4 Data Protection Officer**

Cryptlex has a “Data Protection Officer” who is responsible for matters relating to privacy and data protection. This “Data Protection Officer” can be contacted through email at [legal@cryptlex.com](mailto:legal@cryptlex.com).

#### 1.2.4 Privacy Shield

Cryptlex complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom __to the United States. Cryptlex has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit[ https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)​.

Under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, we are responsible for the processing of information about you we receive from the EU and onward transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for such onward transfers and remain liable in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such information about you on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Cryptlex commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Cryptlex at [legal@cryptlex.com](mailto:legal@cryptlex.com).

Cryptlex has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Cryptlex’s compliance with the Privacy Shield.

An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms. For additional information please refer to [Annex I](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction).

## 2. Data security

Cryptlex is committed to ensuring that your privacy and the data you share with us is protected. We use the best industrial practices to secure and protect the important business data you store within Cryptlex. 

All information is stored securely and is accessed by authorized personnel only. Cryptlex implements and maintains appropriate technical, security, and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and use, and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, or disclosure.

If you have questions or concerns, reach out to us at [security@cryptlex.com](mailto:security@cryptlex.com).

## 3. Retention and deletion

Cryptlex will not retain data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. When a user's account is terminated, all the related Personal Data stored within Cryptlex will be deleted, as required by applicable law. For the user data, collected by you \(our customer\), with an active account, you will have the responsibility to delete the data when required.

## 4. Acceptance of these conditions

We assume that all visitors of our website and users of Cryptlex’s services have carefully read this document and agree to its contents. If someone does not agree with this privacy policy, they should refrain from using our website and services. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy as necessity dictates. Continued use of the Cryptlex website and services after having been informed of any such changes to these conditions implies acceptance of the revised privacy policy. This privacy policy is an integral part of Cryptlex’s [Terms of Service](https://docs.cryptlex.com/legal/terms-of-service).

## 5. Disclosure of personal information

We will reveal a user’s personal information without his/her prior permission only when we have reason to believe that the disclosure of this information is required to establish the identity of, to contact, or to initiate legal proceedings against a person or persons who are suspected of infringing rights or property belonging to Cryptlex or to others who could be harmed by the user’s activities or of persons who could \(deliberately or otherwise\) transgress upon these rights and property. We are permitted to disclose personal information when we have good reason to believe that this is legally required.

## 6. Rights of access, rectification, and erasure

You may inquire as to whether Cryptlex is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or if you believe that your personal information has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an email to [legal@cryptlex.com](mailto:legal@cryptlex.com) or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive \(port\), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Cryptlex. Please include your full name, the email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.

Although Cryptlex makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Cryptlex is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Cryptlex determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Cryptlex will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.

## 7. Opt-Out \(Right To Restrict Processing\)

Where you have consented to Cryptlex's processing of your personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further processing by contacting us at [legal@cryptlex.com](mailto:legal@cryptlex.com). Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-personal information regarding your activities on our site.

  In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.

* **Merger, sale, or other asset transfers.** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such an event, Cryptlex will endeavor to direct the transferee to use personal information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such personal information was collected.
