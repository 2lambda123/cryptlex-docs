#### 1.2.3 GDPR

The European Parliament adopted [the GDPR](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf) in April 2016, replacing an outdated data protection directive from 1995. It carries provisions that require businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. We will apply the GDPR to all the users whose personal data is either stored within Cryptlex or who use our services, whether inside or outside of the EU.

Cryptlex  processes Personal Data both as a Processor and as a Controller, as defined in the Directive and the GDPR.

**1.2.3.1 Controller**

In the GDPR “controller’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union/Member State law.

For user data, as outlined in the section 1.2.1, Cryptlex will be the data controller.

For user data, as outlined in the section 1.2.2, you \(our customer\) will be the data controller.

**1.2.3.2 Processor**

The processor is the entity which processes personal data on behalf of the controller under the controller’s instructions.

We \(Cryplex\) are a data processor.

#### 1.2.3.3. Lawful basis of processing

If you are our User, we process your Personal Data based on your consent, and based on the need to perform the obligations of our contract with you. We collect and use Personal Data for the purposes of providing the Services to our Users at their instruction, processing Personal Data on behalf of Users, improving the Services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.

**1.2.3.4 Data Protection Officer**

Cryptlex has a “Data Protection Officer” who is responsible for matters relating to privacy and data protection. This “Data Protection Officer” can be contacted through email at [legal@cryptlex.com](mailto:legal@cryptlex.com).

## 2. Data security

Cryptlex is committed to ensuring that your privacy and the data you share with us is protected. We use best industrial practices to secure and protect  the important business data you store within Cryptlex. 

All information is stored securely and is accessed by authorized personnel only. Cryptlex implements and maintains appropriate technical, security and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and use, and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft or disclosure.

If you have questions or concerns, reach out to us at [security@cryptlex.com](mailto:security@cryptlex.com).

## 3. Retention and deletion

Cryptlex will not retain data longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. When a user's account is terminated, all the related Personal Data stored within Cryptlex will be deleted, as required by applicable law. For the user data, collected by you \(our customer\), with an active account, you will have the responsibility to delete the data when required.

If someone does not agree with this privacy policy, they should refrain from using our website and services. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy as necessity dictates. Continued use of Cryptlex website and services after having been informed of any such changes to these conditions implies acceptance of the revised privacy policy.

We will reveal a user’s personal information without his/her prior permission only when we have reason to believe that the disclosure of this information is required to establish the identity of, to contact or to initiate legal proceedings against a person or persons who are suspected of infringing rights or property belonging to Cryptlex or to others who could be harmed by the user’s activities or of persons who could \(deliberately or otherwise\) transgress upon these rights and property.
