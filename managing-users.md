## Managing Users

"Users" are your employees at your company that will be logging in and using CryptLex. This way you don't need to share your login credentials with others. You can also manage the privileges given to other users, to make sure they have limited access to your account.



### Adding a new user

Go to "Users" page and click the "Plus" icon to add a new user.
