  Here we quickly go through some terminology related to different licensing
  models. Licenses can be classified into different categories based on time and
  seat.

# Licensing Models

## Time based Licensing Models

### Perpetual Licenses

It refers to licenses which have lifetime validity. A user buys a license and can use your product for lifetime without a need of paying again.

### Subscriptions

It refers to licenses which expire after a certain amount of time period. You customers pay a monthly or a yearly subscription amount and if they don't renew, the license expires. 

## Seat based Licensing Models

### Node-Locked Licenses

A node-locked license is bound to a machine on which the license was activated. It means that the license key cannot be used on any other machine \(if license allows a single activation/seat\).

If license allows multiple activations \(multi-seat\), then after all the activations are used, the license key cannot be used on other machines.

### Floating Licenses

A floating license is temporarily bound to a machine for a specific amount of time. When the time expires the activation \(seat\) is automatically freed up \(if not renewed\), so that any other machine can use the license.

So if your floating license allows for 100 activations \(seats\), then at any instant of time no more than 100 machines can use your application.

## What Should I Choose

Depending on your business requirements you will usually create four types of licenses:

* Node-Locked + Perpetual
* Node-Locked + Subscription
* Floating + Perpetual
* Floating + Subscription

Other than this you can add some other restrictions too like usage count or implement a completely custom licensing model using metadata fields which you can add to your licenses.
